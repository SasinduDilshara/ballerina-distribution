Assistant: The CAP theorem, formulated by Eric Brewer in 2000, states that a distributed data system can only guarantee two of the following three properties simultaneously: **Consistency** (every read returns the most recent write), **Availability** (every request receives a response, though not necessarily the latest data), and **Partition Tolerance** (the system continues operating despite network partitions). Since network partitions are unavoidable in practice, distributed systems designers must choose between consistency and availability when a partition occurs, making CAP a fundamental guide for architectural trade-offs in distributed databases.
Assistant: Databases that prioritize consistency over availability (CP systems in CAP terms) include: **HBase**, which provides strong consistency for Hadoop-scale data; **Apache ZooKeeper**, used for distributed coordination where correctness is critical; **Google Spanner**, which uses TrueTime to achieve external consistency at global scale; **CockroachDB**, which offers serializable isolation; and traditional **relational databases** like PostgreSQL when configured with synchronous replication. These systems may become unavailable or return errors during network partitions rather than risk returning stale or inconsistent data.
