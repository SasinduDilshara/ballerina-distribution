Query: What are the must-visit places in Kyoto and when is the best time to go?
Answer: The best time to visit Kyoto is March–May for cherry blossom season or October–November for autumn foliage. Must-visit places include Fushimi Inari Taisha (thousands of vermilion torii gates — hike the full trail for fewer crowds), Arashiyama Bamboo Grove (arrive before 7 am to beat tour groups), the Gion District (traditional geisha district, best explored on an evening stroll along Hanamikoji Street), and Kinkaku-ji (the iconic Golden Pavilion, Kyoto's most visited attraction).
