Query: What happens to unused annual leave at the end of the year?
Answer: Up to 5 unused annual leave days can be carried forward to the next calendar year. Any remaining unused days beyond that limit are forfeited, unless the employee requests encashment before year-end. To be eligible for encashment, the employee must have completed at least 12 months of continuous service.
