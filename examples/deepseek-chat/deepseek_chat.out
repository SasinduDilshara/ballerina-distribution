Advisor: Yes, that's realistic. Saving $10,000 in 12 months means setting aside roughly $834 per month — about 21% of your $4,000 take-home pay. That's an achievable savings rate for most people with moderate expenses. The key is identifying your fixed costs, trimming discretionary spending, and automating the savings transfer on payday so the money is gone before you can spend it.

Advisor: Based on your listed expenses of $1,900 per month, you have $2,100 left over. To hit your $834 savings target, you'd have $1,266 remaining for everything else — dining out, clothing, entertainment, and any irregular costs. A few practical adjustments: first, automate an $834 transfer to a separate savings account on payday. Second, audit your $100 in subscriptions and cancel anything unused. Third, consider meal prepping to lower your grocery bill by $50–$100. With those changes, you should reach your goal comfortably without feeling deprived.
