Assistant: **Concurrency** means dealing with multiple tasks at the same time by interleaving their execution — tasks make progress by sharing a single resource (e.g., a CPU core), switching between them rapidly. **Parallelism** means actually executing multiple tasks simultaneously using multiple resources (e.g., multiple CPU cores). In short: concurrency is about structure (how you design a program to handle many things), while parallelism is about execution (how many things physically run at once). A program can be concurrent without being parallel (single-core multitasking) and can be parallel without being concurrent (multiple independent processes).
Assistant: Think of a restaurant kitchen. **Concurrency** is like a single chef who juggles multiple dishes — they chop vegetables for one dish, then stir the soup, then check the oven, switching between tasks so everything progresses. Only one task is happening at any moment, but all dishes move forward. **Parallelism** is like having multiple chefs, each working on their own dish simultaneously — the soup chef and the pastry chef work at the same time, truly in parallel. A single chef who multitasks is concurrent; a team of chefs cooking at the same time is parallel.
